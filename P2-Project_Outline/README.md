## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My girlfriend is an occupational therapy assistant and has told me that she doesn't have an easy way to catalogue or select exercises for patients.

I wanted to help her by creating a site where she could create new exercises and patients, browse through exercises by area of the body being used (for example: hand or shoulder), and assign exercises to patients, allowing her to track each patient's progress over time.

### Features
- User Login: OTs and PTs can create their own accounts and login to see their profile page.
- Create/Update Patient: Users can create new patients, track which exercises they perform and log notes for each appointment.
- Add Exercises: Users can add exercises to the database
- Search Exercises: Users can search the database for exercises that utilize a particular muscle group or area of the body.
