## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Researchers studying food waste have found that one-third of food produced globally goes to a landfill uneaten. Sometimes it is hard to track what's in your refrigerator and what food is about to go bad. This app aims to allow users to reduce food waste by tracking expiration dates, allowing users to pick out recipes that will use these ingredients, and add needed ingredients from that recipe to a shopping list.

I got the idea for this project from my mother, who was manually creating a list of her soon-to-expire foods, going through each recipe in her cookbook, and creating the shopping list herself. I thought I could help by automating some of the process for her.

### Features
- User Login: Users can create accounts and log in. Each user will have a profile page.
- Foods About to Expire: Users can add ingredients that are about to expire as well as the expiration date and sort by foods that will go bad soonest.
- Recipe Search: Users can then use that ingredients list to search Google for recipes that use that ingredient.
- Recipe Database: As users find recipes they like, they can add them to their profile.
- Create Grocery List: Users can then use their chosen recipes to create a grocery list. Users can add and delete extra items as needed based on what they already own.

### Technologies
- Java
- MySQL
- Hibernate
- Spring Boot
- Thymeleaf

### What I'll Have to Learn
- How to generate a project using JHipster.
- How to integrate a free API for an ingredients database.
